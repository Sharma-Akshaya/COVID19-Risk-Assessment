Hello everyone! I’m Swapnil, a graduate student at University of Texas at Arlington and former software developer in Health Care domain.
Covid-19 has affected multiple areas like
Social interaction being quarantined
Diagnosing and monitoring health of infected people
Economic disintegration of people living pay-check to pay-check
Prevention of spreading
and plenty more.
Focusing on diagnosing early symptoms of Covid is the goal of my application using healthkit and easily accessible monitoring wearables that won’t affect day-to-day chores. Analysing the data gathered like Heart rate, sleep analysis etc can be vital in diagnosing the disease in early stages and alerting the primary care physician without being on alert every moment of the day and also monitoring already affected patients can be benificial.
I’m a Full-Stack developer looking for assistance in Data Science and Program Management.
Feel free to add to my idea or dropping a reply. Thanks! :)


- Early Diagnosis of COVID-19 using wearables which won’t affect day-to-day chores.
- Continuous analysis of the vitals gathered like Heart rate, sleep analysis, body weight to diagnose the disease in early stages and alerting the primary care physician.
- Contact tracing using GPS to detect exposure for 14 days after being in contact with possibly infected person.
